SiamFC PyTorch
https://github.com/StrangerZhang/SiamFC-PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of SiameseRPN. This project is mainly based on SiamFC-PyTorch and DaSiamRPN.
For more details about siameseRPN please refer to the paper : High Performance Visual Tracking with Siamese Region Proposal Network by Bo Li, Junjie Yan,Wei Wu, Zheng Zhu, Xiaolin Hu.
